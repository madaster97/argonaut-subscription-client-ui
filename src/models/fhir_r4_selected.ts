	 *                         
	 *                            Usage Notes: This flavor and its specializations are most commonly used with the CD datatype and its flavors.  However, it may apply to *any* datatype where the constraints of the type are tighter than can be conveyed.  For example, a PQ that is for a true measured amount whose units are not supported in UCUM, a need to convey a REAL when the type has been constrained to INT, etc.
	 * 
	 *                         With coded datatypes, this null flavor may only be used if the vocabulary binding has a coding strength of CNE.  By definition, all local codes and original text are part of the value set if the coding strength is CWE.

 * A categorical assessment, providing a rough qualitative interpretation of the observation value,    such as “normal”/ “abnormal”,”low” / “high”, “better” / “worse”, “susceptible” / “resistant”, “expected”/ “not expected”.    The value set is intended to be for ANY use where coded representation of an interpretation is needed.   
 *    
 *    Notes:
 *    
 *    This is being communicated in v2.x in OBX-8 (Observation Interpretation), in v3 in ObservationInterpretation (CWE) in R1 (Representative Realm) and in FHIR in    Observation.interpretation. Historically these values come from the laboratory domain, and these codes are extensively    used. The value set binding is extensible, so codes outside the value set that are needed for interpretation concepts    (i.e. particular meanings) that are not included in the value set can be used, and these new codes may also be added to    the value set and published in a future version.
